# AudioWorks-P5

Developing version of AudioWorks using the P5 libary 

Link to live version: https://drexeltranscend.org/projects/AudioWorks-P5/

# Update Notes:
- Compatible with Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge
- Capable of:
  - recording sound
  - synthesizing sound 
  - displaying real time fft and waveforms
  - colour changing 

# Current Issues/Goals: 
- waveform and envelope line is off when drawing
- in waveform/envelope mode, envelope sound keeps playing not waveform 
- sliders and waveform are slow
- updating and repositioning sliders are slow
