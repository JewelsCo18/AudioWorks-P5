# AudioWorks-P5

Developing version of Audioworks using the P5 libary 

# Update Notes:
- Compatible with Chrome and Safari
- Capable of:
  - recording sound
  - synthesizing sound 
  - displaying real time fft and waveforms
  - colour changing 

# Current Issues/Goals: 
- waveform and envelope line is off when drawing
- can't turn waveform and envelope synths off after drawing 
- waveform and envelope sound always set to maximum despite output
- can't use presets once waveform/envelope has been used
- sliders and waveform are slow
- pause function for sound recorder doesn't pause fft just remove sounds
- keyboard sound must also be affected by output slider 
- updating and repositioning sliders are slow
